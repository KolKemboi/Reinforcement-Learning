##  What’s Inside?

### **Environments**
We leverage environments from **OpenAI Gym** and **PettingZoo** to experiment with different RL paradigms.

| Environment         | Library       | Use Case                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CartPole**        | Gym           | A classic control problem to teach an agent how to balance a pole on a cart. Ideal for beginners. |
| **MountainCar**     | Gym           | Learn how to drive a car up a steep hill. Demonstrates the power of reward shaping. |
| **LunarLander**     | Gym           | Simulates landing a spacecraft. Great for understanding continuous action spaces. |
| **BipedalWalker**   | Gym           | Teaches a robot how to walk. Highlights the challenges of locomotion in continuous spaces. |
| **Atari (Breakout, Pong)** | Gym   | Explore deep reinforcement learning (DQN) in high-dimensional environments with visual inputs. |
| **Simple Tag**      | PettingZoo    | A multi-agent pursuit-evasion scenario. Tests cooperative and competitive dynamics. |
| **Multiwalker**     | PettingZoo    | Multi-agent cooperation in a robotic locomotion task. Focuses on collaborative behavior. |
| **Chess**           | PettingZoo    | Demonstrates RL in turn-based strategic games. Ideal for developing advanced strategies. |
